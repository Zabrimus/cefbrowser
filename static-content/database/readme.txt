Here you can find sqlite3 databases, which contains precollected channel information and HbbTV URls/Apps.
Copy the desired database to Release/database/hbbtv_urls.db.

A prefilled database is not needed, because all URLs will be collected at runtime if VDR has been tuned to the desired
channel. But the prefilled database is more convenient, because the URLs are as fast available as possible.
