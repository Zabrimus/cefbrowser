## cefbrowser (Part 2)
Works together with ```vdr-plugin-web``` and ```remotetranscoder```

### Build
```
./setup.sh
meson setup build
cd build
meson compile
meson install
```
The whole binary including all necessary files/libs exists in folder ```build/Release```.

### Configuration
A default configuration can be found in folder config: ```sockets.ini```.

:fire: All ports/ip addresses in ```sockets.ini``` must be the same as for ```vdr-plugin-web``` and ```remotetranscoder```.
It's safe to use the same sockets.ini for all of the three parts (vdr-plugin-web, cefbrowser, remotetranscoder). 

### Start
Change to directory ```build/Release```.

```./cefbrowser  --config=/path/to/sockets.ini --remote-allow-origins=http://localhost:9222```

or if you don't need the possibility to debug the application in Chrome

```./cefbrowser  --config=/path/to/sockets.ini```

### Logging
Log entries will be written to stdout/stderr.
